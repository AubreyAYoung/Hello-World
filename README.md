# Hello-World
Just another repository
Hey there it's Aubrey, I am a student at UVU and I am taking a scripting class.  I enjoy drawing, listening to music, and creating.  My favorite colors are purple and green. 
I made this commit message because the tutorial said I need to keep track of why I made these changes.
